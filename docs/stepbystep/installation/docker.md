### Running from Docker image from Docker hub

The easiest way to get started is to pull the Docker image with the last release of Zingg.

```
docker pull zingg/zingg:0.3.4
docker run -it zingg/zingg:0.3.4 bash
```

Detailed help instructions for working with the Zingg docker image can be found [here](../../setup/workingWithDocker.md).
