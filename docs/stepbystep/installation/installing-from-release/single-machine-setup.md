# Single Machine Setup

Zingg can be easily run on a single machine to process up to a few million records.

To prepare your machine, please do the following steps:

A) Install the specified **JDK** version

B) Apache Spark - Download the specified version from spark.apache.org and unzip it in a folder under home

Please add the following entries to `~/.bash_aliases`

> `export JAVA_HOME=path to jdk`

> `export SPARK_HOME=path to location of Apache Spark`

> `export SPARK_MASTER=local[*]`

C) Correct entry of host under `/etc/hosts`

Run `ifconfig` to find the IP of the machine and make sure it is added to the `/etc/hosts` for localhost.
