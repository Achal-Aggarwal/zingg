# Data Sources and Sinks

Zingg _connects, reads,_ and _writes_ to most on-premise and cloud data sources.

Zingg can read and write to **Databricks, Snowflake, Cassandra, S3, Azure, Elastic, Exasol**, major **RDBMS**, and any **Spark**-supported data sources. \
\
Zingg also works with all major file formats like Parquet, Avro, JSON, XLSX, CSV, TSV, etc. This is done through the Zingg [Pipe](pipes.md) abstraction.
