# Zingg Models

Zingg learns 2 models on the data. 

## 1. Blocking Model

One fundamental problem with scaling data mastering is that the number of comparisons increase quadratically as the number of input record increases.

Zingg learns a clustering/blocking model which indexes near similar records. This means that Zingg does not compare every record with every other record. Typical Zingg comparisons are 0.05-1% of the possible problem space.

## 2. Similarity Model

The similarity model helps Zingg to predict which record pairs match. Similarity is run only on records within the same block/cluster to scale the problem to larger datasets. The similarity model is a classifier which predicts similarity of records which are not exactly same, but could belong together.

To build these models, training data is needed. Zingg comes with an interactive learner to rapidly build training sets.
